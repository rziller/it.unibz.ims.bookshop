('46cd5f18-02a0-43cb-a086-38b3e7578e2d', 'The Missionary Position', 'In this frank and damning expose of the Teresa cult, Hitchens details the nature and limits of one womans mission to help the worlds poor. He probes the source of the heroic status bestowed upon an Albanian nun whose only declared wish was to serve God. He asks whether Mother Teresas good works answered any higher purpose than the need of the worlds privileged to see someone, somewhere, doing something for the Third World. He unmasks pseudo-miracles, questions Mother Teresas fitness to adjudicate on matters of sex and reproduction, and reports on a version of saintly ubiquity which affords genial relations with dictators, corrupt tycoons and convicted frauds. Is Mother Teresa merely an essential salve to the conscience of the rich West, or an expert PR machine for the Catholic Church? In its caustic iconoclasm and unsparing wit, The Missionary Position showcases the devastating effect of Hitchens writing at its polemical best.', 9.99),
